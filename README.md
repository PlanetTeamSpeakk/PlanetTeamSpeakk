### About me
I'm a 22 yo developer from The Netherlands who mainly focuses on Java and especially in the category of Minecraft. I am also well-versed in C#. 
I mostly work on a [JoJo-themed Minecraft mod called JCraft](https://github.com/Arna577/jcraft-eoe) my [own Minecraft mod MoreCommands](https://github.com/PlanetTeamSpeakk/MoreCommands) and plugins for my Minecraft server AquiferMC (now defunct) and as a result of this, my main expertise lies with commands and internal game mechanics.

I am currently learning Rust since it's a very efficient, low-level and memory safe programming language.  

If you want to contact me for whatever reason, you can mainly do so via Discord, my username is `pts0`.  
And since pronouns are a thing you should put on a page like this, mine are he/him.
