### About me
I'm an 20 yo developer from The Netherlands who mainly focuses on Java and especially in the category of Minecraft.  
I mostly work on my Minecraft mod [MoreCommands](https://github.com/PlanetTeamSpeakk/MoreCommands) and plugins for my Minecraft server AquiferMC (now defunct) and as a result of this, my main expertise lies with commands  

I am currently learning C# as I've always wanted to know *at least* one C-language since they are in general the most powerful languages in regard to OS-level stuff.  

If you want to contact me for whatever reason, you can mainly do so via Discord, my tag is `PlanetTeamSpeak#4157` and has been for years.  
And since pronouns are a thing you should put on a page like this, mine are he/him.
